üöÄ One Tap Trails: An Accessible Maze Adventure! Thrilled to share a project I've been working on: One Tap Trails, a maze game designed with a special focus on accessibility for children with motor impairments.
 
üí° The Problem: Children with motor impairments (e.g., limited use of hands or arms) often face barriers when engaging with traditional digital games that require complex controls. My goal was to create an interactive and fun experience that is genuinely accessible and inclusive.

‚ú® The Solution: One Tap Trails One Tap Trails simplifies gameplay to its core, requiring only a single tap or press to navigate the maze.

Key Accessibility & Gameplay Features: Intuitive One-Tap Control: Players move by simply pressing the SPACEBAR or ENTER key. This eliminates the need for precise joystick movements, multiple key presses, or complex mouse interactions.

Automated Path Scanning: The game intelligently highlights available paths one by one in a timed sequence. This allows players to wait for their desired direction to be highlighted before making their single-tap move.

Dynamic Maze Generation: Every game offers a new, uniquely generated maze, ensuring endless replayability and fresh challenges.

Engaging Collectibles: Players collect sparkling gems for points, adding an extra layer of fun and reward.

Clear Visuals & Audio Feedback: High-contrast visuals (black walls, white paths, vibrant highlights) and distinct sound effects for gem collection and winning provide clear feedback.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack: React: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Vite: As a fast and efficient build tool for modern web development.

CSS Grid & Flexbox: For creating the responsive maze layout and overall game structure.

Tone.js: For implementing engaging audio feedback for in-game events.

üåü Why This Matters: Creating inclusive experiences is crucial. One Tap Trails aims to provide a joyful and empowering gaming experience for children who might otherwise be excluded from many digital entertainment options due to control complexities. It's a small step towards a more accessible digital world.
